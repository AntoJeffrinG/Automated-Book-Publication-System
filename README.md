# ðŸ“š BookSpin AI: Intelligent Literary Transformer Workflow

> *"Spin, Review, Perfect â€” with AI and You in the Loop."*

BookSpin AI is a fully automated **literary transformation pipeline** that reimagines any book or story with the help of advanced LLMs (LLaMA3-70B via Groq) while incorporating **human-in-the-loop (HITL)** editing for quality assurance. Built on the powerful [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/) orchestration and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for real-time content scraping, BookSpin AI is an end-to-end system for creating, reviewing, and polishing AI-generated literature â€” and storing it intelligently with rich metadata in ChromaDB.
